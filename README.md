# LIME-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement

All the function are in LIME.m file

Demo.m is the file used to call the functions and get outputs

data folder contains input files

ouput folder contains folders with image name and inside them there are output files of each image

if you want to run test image first rename it to 1.bmp --- 10.bmp (any no. 1-10)

then add it in data folder(replace with previous image with same name) then run the code and you will get the outputs for all the 10 images (which also has a test image)
